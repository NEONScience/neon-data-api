# NEON Data API

## **Introduction**
The NEON Data API (Application Programming Interface) can be used to quickly access data as well as information about NEON's data products, samples, and sampling locations. It provides a simple means of constructing URLs or cURL statements that return information in a common machine-readable format, [JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](https://json.org/json-en.html). 

## **R & Python packages**
The neonUtilities packages are the easiest way to download and reformat NEON data.  

  * [`neonUtilities` R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/neonUtilities/index.html)  
  * [`neonutilities` Python package](https://pypi.org/project/neonutilities)  
  * Check out the ["Use the neonUtilities Package to Access NEON Data" tutorial](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/neondatastackr)  
  
## **REST API Explorer**
The API provides numerous endpoints, some of which provide the option to enter values for specific parameters that allow you to refine your search. To learn more about each endpoint, click on “REST API Endpoints” in the navigation menu. To try each endpoint out, open the [REST API Explorer](https://data.neonscience.org/data-api/explorer/). 

## **GraphQL**
The [GraphQL](https://data.neonscience.org/data-api/graphql/) endpoint allows users to take advantage of the flexibility and efficiency of the [GraphQL data query language](https://graphql.org/) to access NEON metadata. The `/graphql` endpoint affords users the ability to define and receive only desired metadata.
